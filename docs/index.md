# Introduction to the TimePHP Framework

TimePHP, as mentioned in its name, is a PHP framework based on the MVC pattern. Unlike other frameworks, TimePHP is based on **components** which makes it extremely flexible. You can add several packages just by using the `composer` command line.

We've made this framework because we were tired of having to install an entire framework with a general purpose.

Rasmus Lerdorf once said

> Because everyone needs a framework but nobody needs a general purpose framework.
